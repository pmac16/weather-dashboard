  ## Usage

  As a traveler, I want to be able to easily look up the weather for the cities I will be visiting. When I search for a city I am presented with the current and future conditions for the city. I am also given the weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index. I am also presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the weather information for the next 5 days.

  <br>

  I can see all cities I have searched displayed under the search bar. If I click back to a city, I am presented with the weather data again.
